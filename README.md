# PyTorch_tutorial
Implemeted pytorch tutorials.

## Without Torch
Data preprocessing, Layer forward and backward propagation, mini-batch are implemented using only numpy.  
* <code>DeepLearning_Basic.ipynb</code> : Simple Feed Forward Neural Network for digits classification.  
* <code>RNN.ipynb</code> : Among simple RNN models, many to one for sine signal prediction, and many to many were applied to binary adder.  
* <code>LSTM.ipynb</code> : LSTM model for predicting sine signal and character-level language model.  
* <code>Auto-Encoder.ipynb</code> : Auto-Encoder for image restoration.  

## With Torch
* <code>torch_tutorial.ipynb</code> : Basic tutorial for Pytorch.  
* <code>MNIST.ipynb</code>, <code>MNIST_CNN.ipynb</code> : Implement MNIST classification model in a variety of ways.  

## minGPT
This model refers to the following repository: https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT  
  
minGPT is smaller, cleaner and more interpretable than other GPT models.  
And, apply it to the character-level Language Model.
